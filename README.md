# Facebook-data
Is a script to process facebook leaked data from 2019 and transforms the leaked data into organized data.
## Note 
I try my best to transform this data to readable data
<br>But due to the limitation of my computer, i am unable to code more
<br>Please Read The Printed Note
<br>This code will tranform the unorganized file to an organized one (with json format like the screenshot below)
<br>Transformation folder is extra code (Thanks to Ali El Hadi ISMAIL FAWAZ and 8km1 (Eben Khatab))
